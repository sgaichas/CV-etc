## Element 5: Corporate Responsibility, Training, and Professionalism (10)

### Objective: support a safe, secure, and productive workplace; follow required policies and procedures; enhance professional knowledge and skills in support of organizational performance; and promote positive interactions with coworkers, partners, and the public

*1. Safety and Security.  Foster a safe and secure work environment, including complying with agency safety and security, environmental compliance, and IT security policies, plans, and requirements.  Keep work areas free of known hazards and comply with all occupational safety requirements.  Promptly report all known and suspected safety problems to supervisor. * 

* Complied with agency safety and security policies.
* Complied with IT security policies, and upgraded security on github account to comply with possibly forthcoming policy.
* Work areas are free of known hazards. No safety problems to report yet this year.

*2. Policies.  Adhere to DOC, NOAA, NMFS, and SF policies and procedures (e.g., Records Management, T&A, and Telework) and complete required training by established deadlines.  Maintain accountability of assigned government property and report lost property promptly.  Follow NOAA IT policies including directives in “Appropriate Use of Government Equipment.” Comply with travel regulations and policies, including proper use of the government travel cards.  Ensure sensitive Personally Identifiable Information and Business Identifiable Information, both physical and electronic, is protected from unauthorized release, alteration, loss and deletion, and complies with security and privacy policies regarding access to computerized and paper files.*

* Completed required training well before deadlines. 
* Reported all government property upon request. 
* Followed IT equipment and ravel policies. 
* Followed all PII and BII procedures (I rarely work with this type of data).

*3.  Professional Development.  In coordination with supervisor, complete identified opportunities for training and professional development beyond mandatory training requirements to maintain and/or develop professional knowledge and skills.  Provide appropriate documentation of completion of training to supervisor and complete training-related reporting requirements.  Discuss outcomes with supervisor and, as appropriate, share knowledge learned with colleagues.*

* I'm trying to incorporate more automation and open science principles into my daily workflow. This involves trying new R packages for interactive presentations and document writing as well as data wrangling and analysis. 
* I'm also trying to learn more formal project management methods (unfortunately scheduled training conflicted with previously scheduled meetings for me). 
* Seaside chats are providing many opportunites for professional development. 

*4.  Teamwork and Cooperation.  Foster a respectful and inclusive workplace and contribute positively to the office and the agency.   Respond in an appropriate and timely manner to changes in work priorities.  Participate constructively in teams and cross-cutting efforts in support of the office or agency.  Foster teamwork and cooperation by sharing information and expertise.*

* I'm finding google chat helpful to work with our team remotely. I prioritize group meetings and team projects such as the SOE and our website transition and try to give timely input.
* I work on IEA and MSE teams across branches and divisions within NEFSC, and co-chair the national MSE working group (see Element 4, point 2).

*5.  Professional Conduct.  Follow agency professional conduct, diversity, ethics, and EEO policies.   Exhibit competency, integrity, good judgment, and courtesy when interacting with colleagues and the public.*

* Trying my best.
